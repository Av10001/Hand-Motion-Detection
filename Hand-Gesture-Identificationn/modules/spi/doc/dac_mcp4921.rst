MCP4921 (12-Bit DAC with SPI Interface)
=========================================
MCP4921 is a single channel, 12-bit DAC with an external voltage reference and SPI interface. It offers high accuracy and
 low power consumption and is available in various packages. 
 
The MCP4921 device is a part of the MCP4901/MCP4911/MCP4921 product family, which are single channel 8-bit/10-bit/12-bit
 DACs which use external voltage reference (VREF). These devices provide very high accuracy and low noise performance,
 and are suitable for consumer and industrial applications, such as set point control, offset adjustment and sensor
 calibration applications. The low power consumption and small package options make these devices very attractive for
 many portable and battery-powered applications. If two outputs are needed then the MCP4902/4912/4922 dual channel
 product family can be used.
